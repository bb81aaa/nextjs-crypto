I am a software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and creativity. I started coding at the age of 13, creating Java plugins for Minecraft that garnered over 100,000 downloads. While studying accounting and finance at university, I continued to hone my coding skills as a hobby. My dissertation on behavioral economics sparked an interest in user experience and design, which has since become a key focus in my work.

After training to become an accountant, I made the switch to the IT department of a firm and began working as a full-time developer. I now work at Imparta, with a focus on front-end development. My diverse background and experience allow me to bring a unique perspective to my software engineering projects, and I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
